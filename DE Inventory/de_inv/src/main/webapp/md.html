		<p>I have a firm belief that success and attainments are based on
			the learning we get after performing our work and not only based on
			the knowledge we have. Our end goal is of a healthier state and we
			work day and night to accomplish that. We are working incessantly and
			tirelessly to improve ourselves to meet the medical needs of this
			dynamic state.</p>
		<p>As Managing Director of the Corporation, I wish to reinforce
			our commitment to serve each and every person in the state with
			commitment and pride. We continuously strive to increase employee
			independence and self-sufficiency. The Corporation is motivated by a
			zest of providing the people of the state with the best healthcare
			and medicines. We wish to become a textbook example of excellence for
			serving the most suitable medicines.</p>
		<p>There are a number of areas for which we can already report
			progress. The Corporation has floated significant number of tenders
			and EOIs till date for various essential drug list items, essential
			equipment like ventilators and essential health services like 108
			Ambulance Service and Disposal of Bio-Medical Waste Service for
			district hospitals and CHCs of 75 districts. In past 7 months, the
			Drug Department has floated 12 tenders and out of which 9 tenders are
			on the final stage. The rates of 250 drugs have been finalised.</p>
		<p>UPMSCL takes full care of prevention of any sort of harassment
			for women in the Corporation’s premises. A committee has been formed
			under The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,
			Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.</p>
		<p>In an era of advanced technologies and new techniques, we work
			in favor of innovation and enhanced efficiency. It is truly said that
			with success comes responsibility and hence we feel that it is our
			first and foremost duty to serve the people of the state and meet
			their medical needs.</p>

		<p>The diversity, commitment and expertise of our employees,
			working interactively with our vendors and suppliers inspire our
			vision. Each person working for the Corporation is proudly dedicated
			to his work and tries to live up to the Corporate Principles.</p>

		<p>Two most imperative words in UPMSCL are “quality and
			timeliness”. With these two words, we are working for a better future
			for the Corporation, its team members, and eventually the people of
			the state. The journey of UPMSCL is not going to be an easy one and
			moreover, it is never-ending. But I’m confident that with the support
			of my team, the company will be able to achieve its goal and in the
			end benefit the consumers. I am confident that the corporation will
			continue to scale milestones of excellence for years to come.</p>
