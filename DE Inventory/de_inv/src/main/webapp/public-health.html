		<h2 class="main-heading color-text mb-15">What is Public Health
			and why is it Important?</h2>
		<p>Not many of us are aware of the term “Public Health” literally
			even when we have heard for a quite a few terms in our lives. Public
			Health in other words can be termed as “Community Health” and it
			refers to all standardized and efficient measures that are undertaken
			in order to prevent diseases in our society, improve the health
			conditions of the people and research about the injury prevention.</p>
		<p>We cannot succeed in future if we forget about the failures we
			had in the past. Public Health practitioners try to imply some
			practical implications while learning with what went wrong before.
			The world is a complex place to live and hence there are great
			inequalities, health threats and risks. The need of the hour becomes
			to combat these existing and evolving risks.</p>
		<p>Economic crisis, widening inequalities, ageing population,
			increasing levels of chronic disease, migration and urbanization are
			some of the challenges of Public Health in the 21st century as
			defined by World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
		<p>Public Health does not confide to just one place. It holds
			importance and is relevant to all countries of the world-
			irrespective of their demographic features, economical abilities and
			their development stage. In other words from U.S.A. to Ghana, from
			Japan to Zambia all needs Public Health.</p>
		<p>All over the world, Public Health programs work to improve the
			health and well being of communities by identifying risks that effect
			different people in different places at different stages of life and
			finding the best ways to minimise them. It’s about giving all the
			best chance to live long, healthy and fulfilling lives.</p>

		<p>According to a survey, a child dies every three second due to
			some or the other infectious disease. But this can be prevented by
			promoting things like breast feeding, immunization (vaccination) and
			antibiotics. A lot of children across the world die because they do
			not have access to water facility and basic sanitation but public
			health care programs and improve that.</p>

		<p>Public Health helps us to make right choices which help us now
			and in the future. Poor health does not only cost us life but also a
			lot of money. A healthier lifestyle can save us and a lot of cost of
			treatment. It’s about working to ensure that is no one is left behind
			as we strive for better.</p>

		<p>Public Health professionals are not doctors. Doctors give us
			medicines to improve our health when we have already fallen ill. On
			the other hand, Public Health professionals do things that prevent us
			from falling ill. They promote health care equity, promote more
			improved, standardized and healthier lifestyles, conduct research,
			help in health administration, make educational programs and
			recommend various policies.</p>

		<p>It is important to strengthen local, state and national
			healthcare departments in order to see a healthier population in near
			future. We have progressed a lot. The conditions aren’t same what
			they were a decade ago. But there is a lot that still remains to be
			achieved.</p>

		<p>We need to understand what is lacking what makes us have a
			poorer Public Health than others. A lot can be done by just enforcing
			some laws more strictly such as: No smoking indoors or no driving
			without seatbelts, or helmets. All these laws need to be
			strengthened.</p>
